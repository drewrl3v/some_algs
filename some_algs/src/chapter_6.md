# Some Combinatorics

## TODO:

I want to cover combinatorial and inductive analysis of generating famous combinatorial structures:

1. permutations
    -> Inductive
    -> Inplace
    -> From Inversions
2. combinations
3. subsets
4. n-tuples reflected in gray codes
5. r-subsets
6. r-subsets in lexicographical order
