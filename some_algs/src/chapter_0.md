## About

1. This notebook is meant to be an incremental approach to algorithms similar to the style presented in Finite-Dimensional Linear Analysis, Ju. I. Glazman, I. M. & Ljubic. So, there is little to no explanation. Just the problems and their corresponding solutions. Though, I try to order the problems in the most natural order possible.

2. I emphasize and inductive approach early on, but merely use it as an initial guide and I will diverge from inductive reasoning when presented with problems where it's more intuitive to do so. 

3. I assume you've been programming, but perhaps haven't delved into algorithms too deeply.

4. It's perfectly fine to look at the solutions, just make sure you understand them and attempt the problems on your own later. Also be sure to consult additional resources for different perspectives.

5. I don't have the best solutions or explanations out there. Make a copy of this notebook, and see if you can provide your style, your expansions and your insights.
